Growing up, we have always been encouraged to ask questions. Teachers have always said, “There are no dumb questions.” However, Eric Steven Raymond, the author of How to Ask Questions the Smart Way, would beg to differ. His essay explains what smart questions are and how, when, and where to ask them. 

## Why?
Why should we learn how to ask smart questions? Why are they important? Why should I read the rest of this essay? Knowing how to ask smart questions is an invaluable skill, not just for software engineers, but for people in all walks of life. Asking smart questions increases your chances of obtaining the information that you are searching for in a reduced amount of time. 

## What?
Smart questions are precise, succinct, and show that the inquirer has previously researched the topic and has made attempts to solve the problem. The inquisitor should also take steps to state the question as clearly as possible to make it easier for someone to read and reply to. This includes utilizing correct spelling and grammar, clearly formatting any snippets of code, and trimming irrelevant code. Smart questions should also explicitly ask an actual question instead of simply stating that “X does not work.” 

### Where? 
The question should also be posted in the appropriate forum to avoid being overlooked. Many posts are either ignored or presented with unamiable sarcastic replies when asked in the wrong forum.
