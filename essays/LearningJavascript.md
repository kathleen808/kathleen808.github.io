In my opinion, Javascript is a pretty good programming language because it is extremely flexible. For example, it can return objects of different types, and you do not need to specify the types for each of the parameters to create a working function. 
As I was transitioning from learning Java to Javascript, I noticed that Java is much more structured and detailed. In Java, you have to explicitly state several characteristics, such as public or private, static or non-static, the return type, and the type of every single parameter to create a working method. However, in Javascript, you just need to state the function’s name and the parameters’ names to create a working function. That’s it. No parameter types or return types are necessary. This can be just as destructive as it is accommodating. Confusing the order of parameters could easily break your code if you used type specific methods, such as iterating through an array or parsing an int.  

In my experience, athletic software engineering is the best approach to (forcefully) encourage students learn, understand, and actually retain the course material. Usually professors will spend the majority of their class hours lecturing and test their students’ knowledge with a few midterms and a final that can make or break your grade. I believe that this method is ultimately inefficient because many students, including myself, are guilty of memorizing and forgetting the material immediately after taking the exam. However, continuous exposure to the material has been proven to improve students’ long-term retention of the information. Although the WODs can be stressful since they are timed, I believe that they will eventually prove to be beneficial in the future, as interviews often present a similar situation.
