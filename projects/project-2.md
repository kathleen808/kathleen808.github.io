summary: A Hexadecimal Sudoku solver for my ICS 211 class.

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/vacay-home-page.png">

This project was a homework assignment for my ICS 211 class. Dr. Moore, my professor for this class, provided the code for formatting and setting up the sudoku grid and created restrictions to prevent illegal values. This is a program written in Java that solves 16 x 16 sudoku grids. For the puzzle to be considered solved, each row, column, and grid must only contain one of each number (1-9) and letter (A-F). The function takes an ```js int[][]```, which represents the unsolved sudoku grid, as the parameter. 

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
